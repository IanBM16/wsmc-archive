Gone are the days when horsepower referred solely to animals. In its place: fire, oil, and speed.\n\nThe **World Motorsport Championship**, an ambitious project bringing together eleven of the globe’s most daring manufacturers and twenty-two of its boldest drivers, prepares to launch its inaugural campaign. Ten Grand Prix. One champion. Eternal glory.\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 The Calendar: From Roman Cobblestones to American Steel\n\nThe season begins under the looming shadows of ancient ruins at the **Roman Grand Prix**, where elevation changes, narrow avenues, and unpredictable terrain promise chaos from the start. From there, the grid storms through:\n\n- 🇫🇷 *Paris GP* (Le Mans) and *French GP* (Clermont-Ferrand) — twin titans of French engineering pride.\n- 🇨🇭 *Swiss GP* (Bern) — a tactical and altitude-testing ordeal.\n- 🇭🇺 *Austro-Hungarian GP* (Budapest) — where roads are wide, but politics are fragile.\n- 🇮🇹 *Italian GP* (Turin) — the homeland battle for Fiat and Isotta Fraschini.\n- 🇩🇪 *German GP* and *Rhineland GP* — high-speed duels on disciplined roads.\n- 🇺🇸 *Chicago GP* and *New York GP* — the bold American finale in a land still earning its racing credentials.\n\n---\n\n## 🔩 Constructors: Kings, Upstarts, and Outsiders\n\nThe paddock divides into **three tribes**: the *Established Powers*, the *Flashy Contenders*, and the *Dangerous Unknowns*.\n\n### 👑 The Front Runners\n- **Renault** (Rating: 10): The class of the field. Veteran lineup. Iron discipline.\n- **Mercedes** (8): A pair of killers—**Jenatzy** and **Szisz**—with a silver bullet machine.\n- **De Dion-Bouton** (8): **Hémery** and **Fournier** may be the best 1–2 punch in the sport.\n\n### 🎨 The Eye Catchers\n- **Peugeot** (7): Their *pink and white* livery has raised eyebrows, but so has their raw pace.\n- **Opel** (6): Neon purple and wild ambition. **Lautenschlager** is the youngest driver on the grid.\n- **Isotta Fraschini** (5): Led by the aging but fiery **Alessandro Cutillo**, their strategy is all risk.\n\n### ⚠️ The Question Marks\n- **Oldsmobile** (5): **Ripper** and **Sturtz** bring brute force. Will it be enough in Europe?\n- **Minerva** (5): A globe-trotting underdog team. Veteran **Zion Maize** could surprise.\n- **Napier** (6): British elegance and calm—maybe too calm for this grid.\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍✈️ Drivers to Watch\n\n- **Victor Hémery (De Dion-Bouton)** — blistering in testing, a title favorite.\n- **Camille Jenatzy (Mercedes)** — unpredictable, aggressive, and terrifyingly fast.\n- **Barney Oldfield (Peugeot)** — the American phenom brings charisma and chaos.\n- **Fernand Charron (Renault)** — the thinking man’s racer, perfect for the long game.\n\n---\n\n## 🗞️ Headlines in the Paddock\n\n> “All of France is watching Renault and De Dion-Bouton... and all of France is terrified of being embarrassed.” — *L’Écho de l’Automobile*\n\n> “Oldfield says he’ll win or crash trying in Rome. He may do both.” — *The New York Daily Record*\n\n> “You’d be mad not to bet on Mercedes. But everyone’s mad in this sport.” — *La Gazzetta della Velocità*\n\n---\n\n## 🔮 Predictions & Politics\n\nRenault is the favorite—on paper. But *paper burns*, and so too might the fuse of this young championship. Expect:\n\n- Mechanical retirements aplenty  \n- Intra-team rivalries (keep an eye on Fiat’s garage)  \n- A French-German arms race, on wheels  \n- At least one American podium before season’s end  \n- And the first WSMC Champion crowned on the streets of New York\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 The Stage Is Set\n\nOn March 25, 1900, the world will watch Rome. Engines will roar where once gladiators fought. And at the end of it all, a new kind of warrior will be born—the **World Motorsport Champion**.\n\nLet the race begin.\n",
