# 🏁 The Dawn of Speed: A New Century, A New World of Racing

_As featured in the March 1900 Edition of the WSMC Journal_

As Europe marches confidently into the new century, a mechanical revolution is taking hold of the continent—and the world. Gone are the days when horsepower referred solely to animals. In its place: fire, oil, and speed.

The **World Motorsport Championship**, an ambitious project bringing together eleven of the globe’s most daring manufacturers and twenty-two of its boldest drivers, prepares to launch its inaugural campaign. Ten Grand Prix. One champion. Eternal glory.

## 🌍 The Calendar: From Roman Cobblestones to American Steel

The season begins under the looming shadows of ancient ruins at the **Roman Grand Prix**, where elevation changes, narrow avenues, and unpredictable terrain promise chaos from the start. From there, the grid storms through:

- 🇫🇷 *Paris GP* (Le Mans) and *French GP* (Clermont-Ferrand) — twin titans of French engineering pride.
- 🇨🇭 *Swiss GP* (Bern) — a tactical and altitude-testing ordeal.
- 🇭🇺 *Austro-Hungarian GP* (Budapest) — where roads are wide, but politics are fragile.
- 🇮🇹 *Italian GP* (Turin) — the homeland battle for Fiat and Isotta Fraschini.
- 🇩🇪 *German GP* and *Rhineland GP* — high-speed duels on disciplined roads.
- 🇺🇸 *Chicago GP* and *New York GP* — the bold American finale in a land still earning its racing credentials.

## 🔩 Constructors: Kings, Upstarts, and Outsiders

The paddock divides into **three tribes**: the *Established Powers*, the *Flashy Contenders*, and the *Dangerous Unknowns*.

### 👑 The Front Runners
- **Renault** (Rating: 10): The class of the field. Veteran lineup. Iron discipline.
- **Mercedes** (8): A pair of killers—**Jenatzy** and **Szisz**—with a silver bullet machine.
- **De Dion-Bouton** (8): **Hémery** and **Fournier** may be the best 1–2 punch in the sport.

### 🎨 The Eye Catchers
- **Peugeot** (7): Their *pink and white* livery has raised eyebrows, but so has their raw pace.
- **Opel** (6): Neon purple and wild ambition. **Lautenschlager** is the youngest driver on the grid.
- **Isotta Fraschini** (5): Led by the aging but fiery **Alessandro Cutillo**, their strategy is all risk.

### ⚠️ The Question Marks
- **Oldsmobile** (5): **Ripper** and **Sturtz** bring brute force. Will it be enough in Europe?
- **Minerva** (5): A globe-trotting underdog team. Veteran **Zion Maize** could surprise.
- **Napier** (6): British elegance and calm—maybe too calm for this grid.

## 🧑‍✈️ Drivers to Watch

- **Victor Hémery (De Dion-Bouton)** — blistering in testing, a title favorite.
- **Camille Jenatzy (Mercedes)** — unpredictable, aggressive, and terrifyingly fast.
- **Barney Oldfield (Peugeot)** — the American phenom brings charisma and chaos.
- **Fernand Charron (Renault)** — the thinking man’s racer, perfect for the long game.

- Intra-team rivalries (keep an eye on Fiat’s garage)  
- A French-German arms race, on wheels  
- At least one American podium before season’s end  
- And the first WSMC Champion crowned on the streets of New York
